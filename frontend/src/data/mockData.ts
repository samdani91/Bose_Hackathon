    body: "Light exhibits properties of both waves and particles, which is known as wave-particle duality. As a wave, light can be described by wavelength and frequency. As particles, light is composed of photons, which have energy proportional to the frequency of the light. This dual nature was first proposed by Einstein in his explanation of the photoelectric effect, where light striking certain materials can eject electrons.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, this duality is described by quantum field theory, where photons are excitations of the electromagnetic field. The wave properties explain phenomena like interference and diffraction, while the particle properties explain the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering.",

    body: "The photoelectric effect proves light's particle nature. When light hits a metal surface, electrons can be ejected, but only if the light's frequency is above a threshold, regardless of intensity. This contradicts wave theory, which predicted that high intensity light of any frequency should eject electrons.\n\nYoung's double-slit experiment demonstrates wave behavior. Light passing through two slits creates an interference pattern on a screen behind, showing characteristics of waves interfering with each other.\n\nThese experiments revolutionized physics and led to the development of quantum mechanics, which accommodates both aspects of light's nature.",
